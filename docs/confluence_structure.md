  - Document under **Modules**.  
  - Also appear under **Business & Operations → Pricing & SKUs** as high-level feature bundles.  
- **Capabilities** = cross-cutting features that extend Modules.  
- **Components** = backend services that power Modules/Capabilities.  
- **Implementation decisions** (repos, DB, CI/CD, environments) → document under **Architecture & Data → Implementation**.  
- **Operational runbooks** (migrations, deployments, rotations) → document under **Architecture & Data → Engineering Operations**.  
- **Business process or company ops** → document under **Business & Operations**.  
- **Future features, timing, prioritization** → document under **Backlog & Roadmap**.
